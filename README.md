### Cypress F-RAM Master Library for Arduino

**F-RAMs** (*Ferroelectric RAMs*) are *nonvolatile RAMs* with very high endurance (exceeding from 10^12 to 10^14 up to 10^16 read/write cycles **per byte**. F-RAMs store in byte-mode unlike block-mode of flash memories).

This library supports **I2C and SPI APIs** provided with the development kit *CY15FRAMKIT-001*. They where assembled as a lean all-in-one Arduino library to support generic Cypress F-RAM memories.

- The **I2C APIs** include initialization of block, write, current read and random read

- The **SPI APIs** include initialization of block, write/read memory, status register

Arduino standard libraries *Wire* and *SPI*  will be used for best MCU HW support.

Chip specific functions like vendor-IDs, sleep-mode, etc. or pin-handling for /WP and /HOLD are not supported in this version. 


## Examples 

Two sketches within the *CY15FRAMKIT-001 Kit Setup* had been modified and analysed with a logic analyzer. 

- **FRAM_I2C_Example_2.ino:** This sketch was used to test **FM24W256, 256-Kbit (32K x 8) Serial (I2C) F-RAM**

- **FRAM_SPI_Example_2.ino:** This sketch was used to test **FM25W256, 256-Kbit (32K x 8) Serial (SPI) F-RAM**

All test results are part of this distribution and reside in the folders **logic** and **output**. 

Although other Cypress F-RAMs are not tested yet memories with 2-byte addressing should work. Grateful if you can send results of tested F-RAM memories (of different vendors if feasable).

Larger F-RAM memories with 3-byte adressing are not supported until yet.

## UPDATE: Infineon aquired Cypress

2019: Infineon has announced the acquisition of Cypress Semiconductors in order to push further into the automotive, industrial, and Internet of Things (IoT) hardware markets.

2020: Infineon Technologies AG announced the Closing of the acquisition of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation. The San José-based company has become part of Infineon effective as of the Closing.
